# Robowar

Here's an updated README with instructions on how to view or open the main file and the CAD file, including **Assem_A1.SLDASM**:

## Overview

**Robowar** is an exciting project that simulates robotic battles. This repository contains the CAD to create, customize, and simulate robots in a dynamic combat environment. The project provides users with the ability to design unique robots and pit them against each other in strategic duels.

## Features

- **Customizable Robots:** Create and modify robots by configuring various parameters such as weapons, armor, and movement.
- **Battle Simulations:** Robots can engage in battles with various strategies, allowing you to test your designs in combat scenarios.
- **3D CAD Models:** Includes 3D designs for robot assemblies, allowing you to visualize or tweak the physical structure of your robots.
- **Modular Design:** Easily extend the system with new robot components or combat environments.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CoderXAyush/Robowar.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Robowar
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### 1. Running the Simulation

1. Customize your robot:
   - Modify the `config/robot_config.json` file to adjust parameters such as weapons, armor, speed, and health.
   
2. Start a battle simulation:
   ```bash
   python robowar_simulation.py
   ```

3. Watch your robot in action and tweak its design to improve its performance in future battles.

### 2. Viewing CAD Files

The **Robowar** project includes CAD files for the robot assemblies, which are available in the `CAD` directory. If you'd like to view or edit these files:

1. Navigate to the `CAD` folder in the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CAD
   ```

2. Open the main CAD file: **Assem_A1.SLDASM**. This file is a SolidWorks assembly file and can be opened using SolidWorks or any CAD software that supports `.SLDASM` files.
   - If you have SolidWorks installed, simply double-click the `Assem_A1.SLDASM` file to open the assembly.
   - If using other CAD software, ensure it supports SolidWorks assembly files or convert the file to a compatible format using tools like FreeCAD or online converters.
